# Book-Store-Clone-Repository
BookStoreClone is a backend service designed to work in conjunction with the [Book Store]( https://github.com/StanislavaGermanovaa/Book-Store) application. It acts as the database and API layer for managing book data. This repository provides the REST APIs that the main Book Store application consumes to display and interact with book data.
